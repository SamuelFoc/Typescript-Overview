# Installing TypeScript

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which youâ€™ll need to install TypeScript.

2. **Install TypeScript Globally**:

   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal application).
   - Run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript
     ```

3. **Verify Installation**:

   - After installation, verify that TypeScript is installed correctly by checking its version:

     ```bash
     tsc -v
     ```

   - This command should return the installed TypeScript version, confirming that the installation was successful.
