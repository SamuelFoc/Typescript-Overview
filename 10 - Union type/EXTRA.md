In TypeScript, both `type` and `interface` are used to define types for objects, functions, and other structures, but they have some key differences in terms of flexibility, capabilities, and use cases. Here’s a comparison between the two:

### 1. **Defining Object Types**

Both `type` and `interface` can be used to define object shapes, but they have different syntax.

- **Interface**:

  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }
  ```

- **Type**:

  ```typescript
  type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  };
  ```

Both work similarly here, allowing you to describe the structure of an object.

### 2. **Extending and Implementing**

- **Extending Interfaces**: Interfaces can be **extended** (inherited) using the `extends` keyword, making them great for object-oriented programming.

  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  }

  interface Employee extends Person {
    employeeId: number;
  }
  ```

- **Extending Types**: Types can also be extended, but it uses intersection types (`&`) instead of `extends`.

  ```typescript
  type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  };

  type Employee = Person & {
    employeeId: number;
  };
  ```

- **Interfaces for Classes**: Interfaces can be implemented by classes, which is helpful for enforcing specific class structures.

  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string;
    greet(): void;
  }

  class Employee implements Person {
    name: string;
    greet() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
  }
  ```

  **Type** cannot be implemented by a class directly, but it can define structures for objects, functions, and unions.

### 3. **Merging (Declaration Merging)**

- **Interface Merging**: One of the biggest differences is that **interfaces can merge**. If you declare the same interface name twice, TypeScript will merge them.

  ```typescript
  interface Person {
    name: string;
  }

  interface Person {
    age: number;
  }

  const john: Person = { name: "John", age: 30 }; // This is valid
  ```

- **Types Cannot Merge**: If you define a `type` with the same name more than once, TypeScript will throw an error.

  ```typescript
  type Person = {
    name: string;
  };

  // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Person'.
  type Person = {
    age: number;
  };
  ```

### 4. **Union and Intersection Types**

- **Type**: Types can define **union** or **intersection** types, which are useful for combining types or expressing that a value can be one of several types.

  ```typescript
  type StringOrNumber = string | number; // Union type
  type Nameable = { name: string } & { age: number }; // Intersection type
  ```

  Interfaces do not support union types like this, though they can support similar behavior through other means.

### 5. **Function Types and Other Types**

- **Type**: The `type` alias is more versatile and can be used to define not only objects, but also:

  - **Function Types**:

    ```typescript
    type GreetFunction = (name: string) => string;
    ```

  - **Primitive Types**:

    ```typescript
    type StringAlias = string;
    ```

  - **Tuples**:

    ```typescript
    type TupleExample = [number, string];
    ```

  **Interface** is primarily used for describing the shape of objects or classes and cannot define other constructs like primitives, unions, or tuples.

### 6. **Use Case Preference**

- **Interface**:

  - Typically preferred for defining the shape of objects, especially when working with classes and objects.
  - Preferred when working with libraries that rely on declaration merging (like React’s `Component` props or Express middleware).

- **Type**:
  - Preferred for more complex type definitions, such as union, intersection, or function types.
  - Often used when defining primitives, tuples, or when you need more flexibility in combining types.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature                              | `interface`                                   | `type`                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Object shape definition              | ✔️                                            | ✔️                                        |
| Extending (Inheritance)              | ✔️ (`extends`)                                | ✔️ (with `&`)                             |
| Declaration Merging                  | ✔️ (Interfaces merge automatically)           | ❌ (Cannot merge)                         |
| Union and Intersection Types         | ❌ (No union support)                         | ✔️ (Supports `                            | `and`&`) |
| Function, Primitive, and Tuple Types | ❌ (Limited to object shapes)                 | ✔️ (Supports functions, primitives, etc.) |
| Class Implementation                 | ✔️ (Interfaces can be implemented by classes) | ❌ (Cannot be implemented by classes)     |

### When to Use Each:

- **Use `interface`** when you want to describe the structure of objects or classes and expect to extend or merge types.
- **Use `type`** when you need more flexibility, especially for unions, intersections, functions, or primitives.

Both `type` and `interface` are powerful tools, and often you can use them interchangeably, but understanding their differences helps you choose the right one based on your use case.
